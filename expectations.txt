CMSC 100 Journey Expectations



My expectations for this Web Programming course are as follows:


- to learn and have proficiency on the tools and technologies for the development of web applications;

- to acquire the skills and be able to utilize the programming languages and frameworks on web programming mainly the MERN stack;

- to improve my vital teamwork skills as I pave the way for my web developer career;

- to have a successful expedition in this course and have a significant appreciation of the field of web programming.



Bryan Kyle Delfino' Comments:


- First of all, your expectations are very possible to be satisfied in this class.

- It is true that we will be acquiring web development skills, but as developers, we must do some self-studying, researching, and doing of personal projects
  to further improve our skills when it comes to web development. We can gain skills through the CMSC 100 course but we can further fortify them by doing 
  the things that I have mentioned. Plus, this is needed since we know that the nature of web development is that it is fast paced and we, as developers, are
  required to study and know these new technologies.

- It is true that this course will improve cooperation and teamwork. If you heard what I said at the first day of laboratory class, I mentioned that this is 
  a secret pre-requisite of CMSC 128, Introduction to Software Engineering, which is collaborative in nature. Plus, most likely we are going to be working as
  a team in the professional industry. Yes, this will be a great course for teamwork.

- Overall, all your expectations are great! Just keep in mind that our focus in the course is not only to pass it but we have to always target for learning. Plus,
  it's all in the matter of us, the students, whether we'll take the course for granted or take it seriously. If we applied the latter, we'll definitely pass the 
  course and we'll learn new things from it.


That is all! As the senior developers say: LGTM!
